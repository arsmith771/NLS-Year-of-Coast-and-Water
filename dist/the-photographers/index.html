                <h2>The Photographers</h2>
                <p>Many early practitioners who pioneered new methods of photography were based in Scotland or were inspired by Scottish subjects and were recognised internationally. These are just some of the individuals who were trailblazing this new art form in the late 19th century.</p>

              <h3>Julia Margaret Cameron (1815-1879)</h3>
<p>Cameron’s work remains among photography’s  most important and moving portraiture in spite of the technical limitations. Her pursuit of the ‘soul and spirit of her sitter’ enabled her to produce imaginative images that were very different from those  of her contemporaries.</p>
<p>Many of her portraits have a deliberate softness to them that subtly suggests an elusive quality to the sitter or the moment.</p>

<h3>David Octavius Hill (1802-1870) and Robert Adamson (1821-1848)</h3>
<p>Hill and Adamson developed an innovative practice that enabled an aesthetic vision which was unparalleled during their time and since. The photographs created under their partnership were a counter to the dominant narrative in which early photography was seen solely as a documentary process.</p>
<p>Hill and Adamson’s aristry and associations with notable figures of their day merge seamlessly with the social history represented in their photographs. Identifiable landscapes, people, clothes, objects and events are among the elements that can provide insight into the past and help to weave layered and complex narratives. The National Library has a small collection of Hill and Adamson photographs but it’s the National Galleries of Scotland that holds the world’s largest collection.</p>

<h3>William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877)</h3>
<p>William Fox Talbot was the inventor of one of the first photographic processes.  In 1845 he published ‘Sun Pictures in Scotland’ the first photographically-illustrated book to be offered for sale. The book was issued to 100 subscribers including Queen Victoria. Only about 20 complete volumes survive, one of which is in the National Library’s collections.
<p>For the prints, Talbot used the negative/positive process he pioneered and patented just a few years earlier. This invention ultimately offered the field of photography its most enduring technical model in which multiple ‘positive’ prints can be made from a single ‘negative’.  Photographers such as David Octavius Hill and  Robert Adamson would soon go on to use his process to create images of lasting artistic merit and influence.</p>

<h3>James Valentine (1815-1879)</h3>
<p>Like his competitor George Washington Wilson, Valentine recognised the importance of the Scottish landscape as well as its commercial potential. Many places of geological interest and natural beauty in Scotland were difficult for most people, particularly those based in cities, to visit or access. Valentine travelled to every corner of Scotland to capture images, not only recording  physical aspects of the landscape but imbueing his photographs with visual poetry and mystery.

<h3>George Washington Wilson (1823-8193)</h3>
<p>Aberdeen-based George Washington Wilson was Scotland’s most successful 19th century commercial photographer. Wilson and other photographers in his employ captured a wide variety of subjects and locations from urban centres to the most remote islands.</p>
