In 1747 William had made up plans for new buildings at Inveraray with some of the designs completed by John following his father’s death. Although he was less renowned than his brother Robert, John carried out redesigns and work on Hopetoun House and Dumfries House and oversaw the construction of the royal exchange in Edinburgh.

As mathematical instrument maker to the University of Glasgow, Watt made instruments for Professor Joseph Black and, having been asked to repair a model of a Newcomen steam engine, was inspired to make improvements to the machine. In this he was aided by Black’s explanations of latent heat. Watt and his business partner Boulton produced this practical guide to the steam engine. It contains information on everything from building the engine house to the correct amount of tallow to use to grease the pistons. AB.1.82.67",
